    <h3>Essential Oils</h3>
    <p>Using essential oils can be quite overwhelming. There are so many options with brands, what oils to use for me? Then there are carrier oils, different recipes, different ways to use the oils etc. Now you have reps from direct sales companies trying to convice you that their oils are the only ones worth buying (which is why I searched for another company with the same quality and much lower prices).</p>
    <p>When I first started using essential oils, it seemed like there was so many things I needed. I bought a few oils and a diffuser, but soon I wanted to do more with my oils. I wanted to create balms and salves, shampoos, and baby products, but I had no idea where to start. So I would pick up a few things here and there and hope to create something interesting and of course, be disappointed when it didn't turn out. (Some of them while others didn't)</p>
    <p>Simply Earth is here to fix this problem. They send out a subscription box every month (or quarterly) which includes 4 full sized oils, recipe cards, and most of the items needed to make each recipe. The shipping is free and you can cancel or resubscribe at any time! The cost is $39 monthly. I absolutely love this company!</p>

    <p><strong>Immune Booster (Defender)</strong> - I do not yet have this in my collection and I am estatic it is coming in next month's box! Defender is a blend of Clove, Ginger, Grapefruit, and Tea Tree Essential Oil. It helps the immune system fight off all the bacterias going around.</p>
    <p><strong>Ravensara</strong> - Indiginous to Madagascar, the Ravensara tree is a member of the Lauraceae (laurel) family. It is 20 meters tall with several buttress roots at the base, with a reddish bark that is very aromatic, and small green elliptical leaves. Its name in Malagasy means 'aromatic leaf'. It should be noted that Ravintsera (cinnamonum camphora) is not from the same species as Ravensara, and is not the same Essential Oil.</p>
    <p><strong>Lemon</strong> - Lemon Oil has been historically recognized as a cleanser, and Lemons themselves reached the height of fame when the British Navy began using citrus fruits to counteract the effects of scurvy.</p>
    <p><strong>Oregano</strong> - In the ancient times, oregano was commonly used as treatment for digestive problems, respiratory diseases and most skin conditions. It was introduced in North America and other places at the 20th century.</p>
