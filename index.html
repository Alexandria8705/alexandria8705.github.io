       <h3>Essential Oils</h3>
    <p>
      Using essential oils can be quite overwhelming. There are so many options with brands,
      what oils to use for me? Then there are carrier oils, different recipes,
      different ways to use the oils etc. Now you have reps from direct sales
      companies trying to convice you that their oils are the only
      ones worth buying (which is why I searched for another company
      with the same quality and much lower prices).
    </p>
    <p>
      When I first started using essential oils,
      it seemed like there was so many things I needed. I bought a
     few oils and a diffuser, but soon I wanted to do more with my
     oils. I wanted to create balms and salves, shampoos, and baby products,
     but I had no idea where to start. So I would pick up a few
     things here and there and hope to create something
     interesting and of course, be disappointed when it didn't
     turn out. (Some of them while others didn't)
   </p>
   <p>
     Simply Earth is here to fix this problem. They send out a
     subscription box every month (or quarterly) which includes
     4 full sized oils, recipe cards, and most of the items needed
     to make each recipe. The shipping is free and you can cancel
     or resubscribe at any time! The cost is $39 monthly. I absolutely
     love this company!

     I love the idea that I don't have to search for different
     recipes to try and I can try new things each month. I am
     also slowly building up my oil collection, so when I do find
     a recipe online that I want to try I already have some of the
     oils on hand that I might not have purchased on their own!
