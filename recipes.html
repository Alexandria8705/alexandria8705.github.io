    <h1> EO Recipes </h1>
    <p>
      Scared to try new recipes? I know I am. What happens when I buy
      everything I need, make the recipe and it doesn't work, or it
      doesn't turn out the way I like it? Well hopefully I can help you
      from making the same mistakes I have/do!
   </p>
   <p>
   As I make or try new recipes I will update how they worked out for
   me or if I liked the recipe. Feel free to <a href="mailto:alexandriamcgillivray@gmail.com">Email me</a>
   with any recipes you have tried and how they worked out for you!

 <p>
   <strong> Ingredients: </strong> <br><br>
     1 tablespoon <a href="https://simplyearth.com/products/100-pure-fractionated-coconut-oil">coconut oil</a><br>
     1 tablespoon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C34V0BO?aaxitk=wYoirXS77cB1dSpRQQAhLw&pd_rd_i=B00C34V0BO&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=3365067662&pd_rd_wg=7BoaZ&pf_rd_r=BCF2RY7VAH900C1NMQAS&pf_rd_s=desktop-sx-top-slot&pf_rd_t=301&pd_rd_w=xL6mv&pf_rd_i=beeswax&pd_rd_r=bb0fb1a7-b595-4c62-ac77-e83a08e766af&hsa_cr_id=6429825460801">beeswax</a>
     <small>(my grandma gave me some she had, but this can be
     purchased on Amazon)</small><br>
     2 tablespoons <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C4QBXA8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"> shea butter</a><br>
     8 drops <a href="https://simplyearth.com/products/cinnamon-leaf-essential-oil">Cinnamon Essential Oil</a>
     Lip balm containers or chapstick tubes (I used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076HZGM7Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">these</a>)
 </p>

   <strong>Directions:</strong> <br>
   <ol>
     <li> In a small pot over medium low heat melt beeswax, coconut oil,
       and shea butter.</li>
      <li> Remove from head and add lavender and peppermint oils. Whisk
        well to distribute oil throughout the mixture.</li>
      <li> Pour quickly into lip balm containers or chapstick tubes.
        Let cool on counter til hard. </li>
    </ol>
    <br><br><br><br>
  <p>
    <strong>My Thoughts:</strong> I personally love this recipe. I used Lime & Bergamot Essential Oil
    in place of the Lavender and Mint Essential Oil. It smells great,
    and helps with my chapped lips during the cold winters.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tip:</strong> If you like your lips often (like I do) add 1 teaspoon of honey
    to make your lip balm sweet!

  <!--Shampoo and Conditioner-->
  <h3>Shampoo & Conditioner Recipe</h3>
  <img class="displayed" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ae/14/b5/ae14b55235d596fb5696f5123bdca923.jpg"
  height="400" width="600">
<p>
  <em> This will be thicker than most recipes found online</em>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Shampoo Ingredients: </strong> <br><br>
    1 1/4 cup/310ml maple water, coconut water, distilled water, purified or filtered
    water <br>
    1 tablespoon oat flour or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XVJ8JNY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1">NuNaturals Oat Fiber</a><br>
    4 tsp tapioca or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BTNDHUQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"> arrowroot starch</a><br>
    1 tbsp bicarbonate of soda<br>
    8 drops pure essential oil <em>(I used mint and lavender)</em><br>
</p>

<p>
  <strong> Conditioner Ingredients: </strong> <br><br>
    1 tbsp apple cider vinegar or coconut vinegar<br>
    2 drops rosemary essential oil<br>
    3/4 cup almond or coconut milk<br>
    1.5 tablespoon oat flour or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XVJ8JNY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1">NuNaturals Oat Fiber</a><br>
    1.4 tsp tapioca or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BTNDHUQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"> arrowroot starch</a><br>
    8 drops pure essential oil <em>(I used mint and lavender)</em><br>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Directions:</strong> <br><br>
  Mix the chosen liquid, oat flour and starch in a small saucepan and place over
  a low-medium heat. Sitr constantly with a rubber spatual to get to the edges,
  until thickened to a light gel, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a jug and leave
  to cool before stirring in the bicarbonate of soda and essential oils and
  transferring to a re-purposed shampoo container.
</p>
 <p>
   <strong>My Thoughts:</strong> This does not lather like the normal shampoo
   would. It also seems to not spread well, but it does smell great. Also, on the
   downside they say it take at least a week for your natural oils to balance
   out, but I can't get past the second use. It makes my hair super greasy, which
   should be the natural oils in my hair. I use this once a week, and not more than
   once before I use regular shampoo.
 </p>
 <p>
   <strong>Tip:</strong> I tried boiling the water for this recipe to purify it
   and then added it to the saucepan with the other ingridents. DO NOT do this
   it make the arrowroot gel up as the water is hot already and it doesn't mix
   like it is suppose to! Use cold water for your liquid choice.
   <br>
   <br> Each recipe filled a 8oz <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NCKPTLT/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">shampoo bottle</a>
   and I used <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XC1NX61/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1"> waterproof labels</a>
   to label them!

 <!--Laundry Soap Recipe-->
 <h3>Laundry Soap Recipe</h3>
</p>
<img class="displayed" src="http://www.ourgom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Homemade-laundry-detergent-WHY-its-so-good-Ask-Anna.jpg">
<p>
 <strong> Ingredients: </strong> <br><br>
   2 cups Hot Water <br>
   1 cup baking soda<br>
   1/3 cup salt<br>
   1 cup <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XWGPRJQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Castile Soap</a><br>
   10 drops <a href="https://simplyearth.com/products/lavender-essential-oil">lavender essential oil</a><br>
   Mason Jar<br>
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Directions:</strong> <br><br>
 Mix all the ingredients together. Use 1/4 cup for 1 load of laundry. Shake
 well before each use. There is no binding agent for these ingredients and they
 will settle over time!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>My Thoughts:</strong> First off this smells good and is relaxing. It
  makes my laundry room smell great also! The clothes come out smelling fresh
  and clean. PLUS this is way cheaper than purchasing laundry soap with all
  the chemicals in them!
<p>
  <strong>Tip:</strong> I'd advise having a container that you can easily shake.
  Be sure to shake well before each use. I'd also recommend
  having a cup to measure how much to put into each load.
