<p> I use <a href="http://www.cinchshare.com">Cinch Share</a> as a posting
  tool. If I were doing an hour party I set posts in 5 minute increments.
</p>

    for people to join.

  <br>Next, I post a roll call (Normally 5 minutes til party time) so I can see
  who will be joining the party.
</p>

<p> The next post has no image. I post "Are you new to Simply Earth
  products? PM me your email address and I'll send you a list of
  <a href="aromas.html">aromas</a> and pricing on products to get you started.
  Don't worry you won't be added to a mailing list!"
</p>

<p>
  After this I will post to introduce myself or the products. If you are able
  to I would recommend Going Live on Facebook while you do your introduction!

  Next up is a game!! You can give anything away. If a local person wins
  I would give a oil I have on hand. If it were someone I need to mail
  something to I would just purchase a $10 gift card and email it to them.
  Be sure to include a game at the beginning to help get your customers
  engaged.
