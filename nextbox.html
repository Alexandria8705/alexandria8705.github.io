    <strong>Immune Booster (Defender)</strong> - I do not yet have
    this in my collection and I am estatic it is coming in next month's
    box! Defender is a blend of Clove, Ginger, Grapefruit, and Tea Tree Essential Oil.
    It helps the immune system fight off all the bacterias going around.

  <p>
    <strong>Ravensara</strong> - Indiginous to Madagascar, the
    Ravensara tree is a member of the Lauraceae (laurel) family.
    It is 20 meters tall with several buttress roots at the
    base, with a reddish bark that is very aromatic, and small
    green elliptical leaves. Its name in Malagasy means
    'aromatic leaf'. It should be noted that Ravintsera
    (cinnamonum camphora) is not from the same species as
    Ravensara, and is not the same Essential Oil.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Lemon</strong> - Lemon Oil has been historically
    recognized as a cleanser, and Lemons themselves reached
    the height of fame when the British Navy began using citrus
    fruits to counteract the effects of scurvy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Oregano</strong> - In the ancient times, oregano was
    commonly used as treatment for digestive problems,
    respiratory diseases and most skin conditions. It was
    introduced in North America and other places at the 20th
    century.
