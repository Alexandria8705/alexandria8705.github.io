<p> Use the Mystery Host Party when you are lacking in available
  hostesses.
  <br>I use <a href="http://www.cinchshare.com">Cinch Share</a> as a posting
  tool. If I were doing an hour party I set posts in 5 minute increments.

  <br>Last Reminder

<p> The next post has no image. I post "Are you new to Simply Earth
  products? PM me your email address and I'll send you a list of
  <a href="aromas.html">aromas</a> and pricing on products to get you started.
  Don't worry you won't be added to a mailing list!"
</p>

<p>
  After this I will post to introduce myself or the products. If you are able
  to I would recommend Going Live on Facebook while you do your introduction!

  <br>Next up is a game!! You can give anything away. If a local person wins
  I would give a oil I have on hand. If it were someone I need to mail
  something to I would just purchase a $10 gift card and email it to them.
  Be sure to include a game at the beginning to help get your customers
  engaged. Anyone who comments on this photo would be placed into a drawing
  to win at the end of the party.

  Aroma
  Peppermint essential oil is extracted through steam
  distillation from the fresh or partly dried plant.
  It then produces a pale yellow or colorless liquid
  with a strong fresh, minty green odor. This essential
  oil blends well with a variety of other similar toned
  oils such as Basil, Black Pepper, Coriander, Eucalyptus,
  Frankincense, Geranium, Lavender, Lemon, Palmarosa,
  Rosemary, Spearmint, Wintergreen, and Ylang Ylang.

  <br>Wool Dryer Balls<br>
  (Add your link here) <br>
  <br>
  Save over $2000 in lifetime savings with dryer balls!
  <br>
  You saw that right, over $2,000. How does that work?
  Well, here's the breakdown.
  <br>
  $0.35 a load
  24 loads a month
  12 months a year
  About $100 a year to dry you clothes
  Which adds up to $8000 over your lifetime on drying clothes.
  Dryer balls decrease drying time by about 30%. That means
  you save $2,419.20. A nice chunk of change (for a whole lot
  of lattes, in my case :)).

  alt="DIY Natural Chest Rub">
  Breathe Easy $10
  <br>
  All Natural Chest Rub
  <br>
  Ingredients (for a small jar):
  <br>
  1/4 c. pressed coconut oil
  10 drops Breathe Easy blend
  5 drops Peppermint essential oil
  5 drops Eucalyptus essential oil
  Simply add the drops of essential oils to your
  coconut oil and stir until it's evenly combined.
  Place your mixture into a small jar and store in a
  cool, dry place.
  <br>
  This cleaner version of a soothing chest rub is so quick and simple to make! You could make it in the fraction of the time that it takes you to run to the store to grab a less-natural jar of vapor rub.

  Next I go Facebook Live again with 4 colored envelopes each With
  a date and time on it, asking people to pick a time and date to
  host their own parties. In each enevelope is a prize. Which I open
  and anounce on Facebook Live. If someone picks one they recieve
  the prize in the evelope!

  <img src= "https://m.cinchshare.com/3ce11/368cd51c1e8c1d5b9d3f12d821e.jpg">

  No better way to make your parties more enjoyable than asking for opinions!
