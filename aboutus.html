<h2> The Main Character: You </h2>
    <p>
      You are the main character of our story.
      You love natural because you care about your family and friends.
      You want to make sure that the world and home you make for them
      right now is a natural one and the one you leave behind for the
      next generation is better than the one now. Because of this, you
      want to know what is in the products you use. You don't just want
      it to say that it is natural, but you want to know that each and
      every ingredient is natural. It isn't about you, it is about
      caring for others. </p>

<h2> The Problem </h2>
    <p> Essential oils cost too much. You hate bringing in unnatural
        products into your home and apartment, but when faced with the
        choice between natural and your wallet, you often have a
        difficult choice. Do you take the risk on the harmful effects
        artificial products could have in order to make ends meet?
        Or do you sacrifice your wallet for natural products? And on
        top of it all, all these so called natural companies and just
        greenwashing and charging extra just because they throw a green
        label on it.
      </p>

  <h2> Meet Simply Earth </h2>
    <p> We have been faced with the choice too many times in our past
        between natural and our wallet. We were afraid of the harmful
        effects artificial products could have, but also didn’t have
        thousands of dollars to completely make our home natural. We
        are mothers, fathers, and friends. Having been extensively
        trained in oils, we made a natural shoe odor eliminator ourselves
        and started selling it. Some of the key ingredients in our odor
        eliminator were essential oils and when we were buying them in
        bulk from a high quality supplier, we realized quality essential
        oils don’t have to break the bank, nor does making your home
        natural.
    </p>

  <h2> Essential oils cost too much, so we fixed it. </h2>
    <p> After realizing we can get high quality essential
        oils for ½ the price the big oil companies were making us
        pay, we dug in deep to make sure we could outmatch their
        quality while keeping prices low. We source our oils from
        farms all around the world, wherever the oil grows best.
        We bottle them in-house, to control quality. We double test
        everything to make sure it is pesticide free and pure so you
        can enjoy natural products for a price that does not break
        your wallet.
